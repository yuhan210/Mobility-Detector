Scripts to evaluate and try out different classifiers.
1. downsample.py downsamples any sensor trace.
2. extract-accel-features.java extracts accelerometer feature vectors given the trace.
3. extract-wifi-features.java extracts WiFi feature vectors given the WiFi trace. 
4. extract-gps-features.java extracts GPS feature vectors given the GPS trace.
5. extract-gsm-features.java extracts GSM feature vectors given the GSM trace. 
6. eval-classifier.sh runs one specific classifier on the given testing file, given the training files. 
7. run-harness.sh runs eval-classifier.sh after downsampling according to a user supplied argument.
