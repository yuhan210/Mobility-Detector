Test variation of accuracy as a function of sampling rate for one on one classification i.e pairwise and not multi label.
It looks like this experiment doesn't give us too much accuracy variation. In other words, the accuracy seems to be really good irrespective of how low the sampling rate is. 
The next experiment therefore, is to study the accuracy of multi label classification (again as a function of sampling rate).
